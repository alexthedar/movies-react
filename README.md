```

## e2e Test

```
npm run test:e2e
```

### Acceptance Criteria

1. Allow a user to be able to search for a movie given a search string
2. Manage the storage and retrieving of data using Redux
3. Display results in a grid format
4. Create production quality code
5. Return a link to a repo of code
6. BONUS POINTS - Make the UI more attractive

### Stocks-react

This project uses parts recycled from my [stocks-react](https://github.com/alexthedar/stocks-react) repo. Stocks-react uses the iex api to GET and display top 100 stocks on the iex market. It also allows the user to search for stocks using stock symbols.

### Create-react-app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project only uses the start and test react-scripts that come included with create-react-app however CRA includes build and eject as well. I have included the 'create-react-app' below for reference.

### Available create-react-app Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
